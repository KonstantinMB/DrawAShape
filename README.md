# DrawAShape
The main goal of this project is to learn and use all OOP principles and provide a user friendly application for drawing different types of shapes!

While developing this university project, I learned and implemented these concepts:

1. Woking with the .NET Framework
2. The 4 pillarts of OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
3. How & when to use interfaces
4. The main functions in the Windows Forms Application toolkit
5. Working with (X,Y) Point locations on the app
6. Serialization and how to open & save files on your machine
7. Working with libraries

Next up are some pictures and GIFs of my project and how it basically works:

First off, this is how the app looks when you open it
/

- On the right-hand side you need to choose which shape you want to draw!
- In the upper-left corner, there is an 'Edit' strip, which opens a menu with different functions that the program can do.
- In the bottom-left corner, the total area of the shapes, drawn on the graphic is shown.

Here, you can see how the shapes are actually drawn. By dragging your mouse up/right/down/left.
The rectangle/square:
